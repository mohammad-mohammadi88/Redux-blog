# Project

This is a sample Redux blog project using redux power.

# Installation

 First you should clone it from https://github.com/mohammad-mohammadi88/Redux-blog
 with command `git clone https://github.com/mohammad-mohammadi88/Redux-blog` and start using it.

# Technologies
We used [React](https://react.dev/) and [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to show that we have some knowledge about it. Also we used pure css(with no frameworks or libraries), and mostly used [tsx](https://docs.fileformat.com/programming/tsx/) format to develop with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make it more readable for developers. The server was a simple json-server that deployed on Render with url `https://redux-blog-g7jz.onrender.com`. You can go and visit it

# Usage
when you clone  it from [github](https://github.com), you will see [vite](https://vite.dev/) [React](https://react.dev) codes and a server folder named mock-api that I created for creating fake backend with json-server to send requests and saving data. You can start server with commands

    npm run server
    #or
    yarn server
    #or
    pnpm server
    
and start developing the project with commands

    npm run dev
    #or 
    yarn dev
    #or
    pnpm dev
    
and you can start them with a single command of

    npm start
    #or
    yarn start
    #or
    pnpm start
    
To start both with a single command you do not need any package or else. You only need to install dependencies with commands like

    npm i => // npm install

    pnpm i => // pnpm install

    yarn

# server

For server you do not need to do any thing. Server was deployed on https://redux-blog-g7jz.onrender.com. The server is very simple and easy json-server. To see product add "/posts" to url and for users list add "/users".


# conclusion
 This is a simple blog used Redux toolkit tools like createAsyncThunk, createEntityAdapter and Redux dev tools.
I hope it might be useful for you.
